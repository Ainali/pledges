# Pledges for 2021

This repository contains materials about things I am publicly committed to. 

## Pledge

I pledge to observe the following principles in my knowledge-related volunteering and personal activities:

1. only engage in activities where I see sufficient societal benefit;
1. publicly document my insights into the societal benefits of activities that take up a major part of my time;
1. take measures to minimize the likelihood that engagement in these activities is detrimental to the health and well-being of myself or others;
1. encourage open participation, scrutiny and repurposing of the processes and workflows underlying my activities;
1. release public outputs of my activities under an [open license](https://opendefinition.org/licenses/);
1. present these principles as my starting point when negotiating collaborations with others;
1. maintain a [list of frequently asked questions](faq.md) related to activities covered by these principles;
1. allow for exceptions, and feed data about them into future versions of these principles.
1. review these principles at least annually and refine them as necessary.

## Background and credits

I have previously used [similar pledges](http://www.openbydefault.se/pledge/) when i ran Open By Default, inspired by [Erin McKiernan](https://emckiernan.wordpress.com/pledge/) and these were forked from Daniel Mitchen after his [new years tweet](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/1344728435210514436). I might update them during the year.
