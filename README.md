# About

This repo contains materials about things I am publicly committed to. For the moment, consider this a draft &mdash; I will create releases for versions that I consider reasonably comprehensive and up to date.

# Pledge

I pledge to observe the following principles in my knowledge-related professional and volunteering activities:

1. only engage in activities where I see sufficient societal benefit;
1. publicly document my insights into the societal benefits of activities that take up a major part of my time;
1. take measures to minimize the likelihood that engagement in these activities is detrimental to the health and well-being of myself or others;
1. encourage open participation, scrutiny and repurposing of the processes and workflows underlying my activities;
1. release public outputs of my activities under a Wikimedia-compatible license, and under CC0/ in the Public Domain if I am the sole contributor;
1. use these principles as my starting point when negotiating collaborations with others;
1. maintain a list of frequently asked questions related to activities covered by these principles;
1. allow for exceptions, and feed data about them into future versions of these principles.
1. review these principles at least annually and refine them as necessary.
